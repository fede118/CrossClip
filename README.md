This is a Kotlin Multiplatform project targeting Android, Web.

* `/composeApp` is for code that will be shared across your Compose Multiplatform applications.
  It contains several subfolders:
  - `commonMain` is for code that’s common for all targets.
  - Other folders are for Kotlin code that will be compiled for only the platform indicated in the folder name.
    For example, if you want to use Apple’s CoreCrypto for the iOS part of your Kotlin app,
    `iosMain` would be the right folder for such calls.

This project was generated by AI, I had to fix many issues to make it work. And I don't like many things in it.
Specially the Architecture and the lack of DI.
I want to fix this in the future but I wanted to push an MVP version of it.
Things to do:
- Add DI with Koin
- Add Navigation with compose navigation
- Expand/refactor MVVM architecture (AI made it sloppy)
- Centralize common compose components
- Split the main.kt in wasmJs into subcomponents (I already did a bit of this in the androidMain)
- WasmJs doesn't persist the user session.
